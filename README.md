What this code does is simulate a game of Egyptian rat screw where either a
specified number of players is created to play with or an automatic of 2. The
program will then determine the rules of the game and follow through play as by
the rules. If a player slaps it is chosen at random who will slap first if they have
the same pattern to look for. In addition the player who wins all the cards in the pile
is then responsible for starting the next pile. Play continues until one player has all the cards
